# AudioEqualiserv3
Modifies the volume of each program with audio output to match a set target in %.

Comes with fully-featured UI to edit global volume target, volume allowance and shift speed.
Each global setting can be configured per-program as well as disabled for specified programs.

NOTE: Some files will say that they were decompiled, I lost the source code while doing a reformat. This version of the program is rewritten from fragments of the original file and some better features, hence the v3
